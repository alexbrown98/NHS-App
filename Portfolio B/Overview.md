# Portfolio B

## Overview

For this project we have been tasked by UH Bristol, NHS Foundation Trust  to develop a mobile application that allows doctors and students to more easily organise and keep track of bedside teaching sessions and lectures.

  

Our clients are two medical doctors who work in the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Throughout their time working in the hospital they found a common problem which occurs. Doctors in the hospital want to receive feedback from students attending their teaching sessions in order to display in a portfolio, while students want teaching on a variety of different topics. However due to the hectic environment of the hospital and the lack of a modern way of creating and booking sessions, this is seldom the case for students and doctors. This means doctors don’t receive feedback and students don’t get to choose which sessions they attend. Other difficulties such as scheduling problems and cancellations also often occur leaving doctors and students frustrated.

  

The project presented to us was the idea of a web/mobile application in which doctors could organise a time and place to run bedside teaching, and create a sessions online. The students would be able to search for opportunities which they could sort by topic and then book the sessions online. After the session, the application would push a feedback form for students to complete, which the doctors would then receive and be able to place in their portfolio.The application would also have a function that allows communication between the doctor and student attendees. This would let doctors update any attendees if any changes to the sessions occurred or if the sessions had to be cancelled. Furthermore, it would allow students and doctors to share resources that are used and discussed during teaching sessions. The app would also advertise any research studies available for students to take part in and let them contact the researcher.

  

Our plan for the project is to develop a web application that can be used on both mobile and desktop. Doctors and students will have to create an account to use the app and to verify they are part of NHS Bristol or University of Bristol. Then doctors can create an event by giving a time/location (in the hospital) and a topic, and students can view the available events, being able to sort by date and topic. Students can then book available sessions. After the session has been completed the students will be prompted with a feedback form that they are required to complete before being able to attend any other sessions. On the app, doctors can also advertise any research opportunities that students can participate in. These can be viewed by students in a similar way to the bedside teaching.

## Product Evaluation

Unfortunetly due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus we were unable to conduct any evaluation for our product in the final stages of development. This is because we couldn't interact with our client or any target users so we were unable to show them our product and get any feedback.

Though just before the outbreak, we had a meeting with our client and showed them a mostly working version of our product and they were able to give us some feedback. We discussed of how satisfied they were with the current features and what should be our priorities for final release. We were able to use this feedback during final stages to ensure we were keeping to what the client wanted.

However if Coronavirus had not taken place we would have evaluated through multiple methods. Firstly we would have liked to test our product on some final users (e.g doctors and students) and gotten feedback from them. This would ideally be done through a distributed questionaire, after a testing phase where multiple students would have used the application in their working environment. They would have answered questions such as; How easily were you able to navigate through the app to find what you needed? Did you find the layout clear and easy to understand? These questions would be designed to find out how easy and useful users are finding the app. Using this feedback we could potentially made adjustments to suite the needs of the user.

We would have also had an in-depth discussion with our client. Where we have got feedback about how sastisfied the client was with the final release of the product and how well they they think it performs.
Using all this gathered information and feedback we may have been able to adjust or refine any final parts before handing over the product to the client.
